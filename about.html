          <p>We believe honesty is important, honesty is being able to stomach hard truths, it's about having
            difficult conversations and facing harsh realities, being accountable for our actions and taking full
            responsibility for not only ourselves but each other, as we are all connected.</p>
          <p>Humility in a world of fast money, fast cars and fast fashion, rarely do we take pride in blending in, in
            silent celebrations, in being mindful of others, the world is seemingly caught up in a trance, boasting
            and posting about every small achievements, presenting only an instagrammable version of ourselves,
            lacking authenticity.
          </p>
          <p>Honor to ourselves by establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries, by being conscious of what we
            consume and where we place our attention. Honoring others and their boundaries and wishes, by mutual
            respect.</p>
          <p>Grace, being careful where we put our energy and focus, by taking the time to think about the bigger
            picture so that we can navigate our shared path with care and full awareness.
